	abstract = {Objective: This study applied the vulnerability framework and examined the combined effect of race and income on health insurance coverage in the {US}. Data source: The household component of the {US} Medical Expenditure Panel Survey ({MEPS}-{HC}) of 2017 was used for the study. Study design: Logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations between insurance coverage status and vulnerability measure, comparing insured with uninsured or insured for part of the year, insured for part of the year only, and uninsured only, respectively. Data collection/extraction methods: We constructed a vulnerability measure that reflects the convergence of predisposing (race/ethnicity), enabling (income), and need (self-perceived health status) attributes of risk. Principal findings: While income was a significant predictor of health insurance coverage (a difference of 6.1–7.2\% between high- and low-income Americans), race/ethnicity was independently associated with lack of insurance. The combined effect of income and race on insurance coverage was devastating as low-income minorities with bad health had 68\% less odds of being insured than high-income Whites with good health. Conclusion: Results of the study could assist policymakers in targeting limited resources on subpopulations likely most in need of assistance for insurance coverage. Policymakers should target insurance coverage for the most vulnerable subpopulation, i.e., those who have low income and poor health as well as are racial/ethnic minorities.},

	abstract = {Introduction:
{AIDS} Drug Assistance Programs ({ADAPs}) provide financial support for medical care for people living with {HIV} ({PLWH}) in the {US}. Federal policy requires that clients recertify for the program every 6 months, which has been described as a barrier to care access. Our objective was to describe the prevalence and factors associated with {ADAP} disenrollment in Washington State.

Methods:
Between 2017 and 2019, we categorized {ADAP} clients by the success of their recertification applications as: 1) continuously enrolled, 2) ruled ineligible, or 3) disenrolled if they failed to recertify. We compared individuals who were disenrolled to those who were continuously enrolled by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and engagement with case management using data from the Washington State {HIV} Surveillance and Ryan White data systems.

Results:
From 2017 to 2019, 5480 clients were enrolled in {ADAP}, of whom 1423 (26\%) were disenrolled and 984 (18\%) were ruled ineligible at least once. Compared to those who were continuously enrolled, disenrolled {PLWH} were more likely to be Black (unadjusted prevalence ratio ({PR}) vs White 1.31, 95\% {CI} 1.17–1.46), uninsured ({PR} vs private insurance 1.24, 95\% {CI} 1.10–1.40), and younger ({PR} 25–34 vs 35–44 years 1.23 95\% {CI} 1.08–1.41). The median time to return after disenrollment was 12 months (95\% {CI} 8–19 months).

Conclusions:
Disenrollment after failure to recertify was the most common reason why {PLWH} lost {ADAP} coverage in Washington. {ADAP} recertification procedures disproportionately impact Black, young, and uninsured {PLWH} and may contribute to disparities in {HIV} outcomes.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of lack of health insurance among adults aged 18 to 64 years for each state and the United States and to describe populations without insurance.

Methods
We used 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data to categorize states into 3 groups on the basis of the prevalence of lack of health insurance in each state compared with the national average (21.5\%; 95\% confidence interval, 21.1\%–21.8\%): high-insured states (states with an estimated prevalence of lack of health insurance below the national average), average-insured states (states with an estimated prevalence of lack of health insurance equivalent to the national average), and low-insured states (states with an estimated prevalence of lack of health insurance higher than the national average)., We used bivariate analyses to compare the sociodemographic characteristics of these 3 groups after age adjustment to the 2000 {US} standard population. We examined the distribution of Medicaid expansion among the 3 groups.

Results
Compared with the national age-adjusted prevalence of lack of health insurance, 24 states had lower rates of uninsured residents, 12 states had equivalent rates of uninsured, and 15 states had higher rates of uninsured. Compared with adults in the high-insured and average-insured state groups, adults in the low-insured state group were more likely to be non-Hispanic black or Hispanic, to have less than a high school education, to be previously married (divorced, widowed, or separated), and to have an annual household income at or below \$35,000. Seventy-one percent of high-insured states were expanding Medicaid eligibility compared with 67\% of average-insured states and 40\% of low-insured states.

Conclusion
Large variations exist among states in the estimated prevalence of health insurance. Many uninsured Americans reside in states that have opted out of Medicaid expansion.},

	abstract = {Background
Uninsurance for young adults ({YAs}) was greatly reduced by the Affordable Care Act ({ACA}). However, reforms may not be equally beneficial for all {YAs} and certain policies may exacerbate, rather than resolve, pre-existing disparities.

Objective
To investigate inequalities in {YAs}’ insurance coverage pre- (2000–2010) and post-federal health reforms (dependent coverage expansion, 2010–2013, and Medicaid/Marketplace expansions, 2014–2016), among a nationally representative sample.

Design
A difference-in-differences estimator (controlling for sociodemographics) was used to determine the effects of the {ACA} for young adults (ages 19–25) compared to adolescents (ages 13–18) and older {YA} (ages 26–30) counterparts; triple-difference estimators quantified differential policy effects by sociodemographics.

Participants
Three hundred eighty-seven thousand six hundred thirty-five participants in the 2000–2016 National Health Interview Survey.

Main Measures
Respondents reported their health insurance coverage types during the last 12 months, reasons uninsured, and detailed sociodemographics.

Key Results
An adjusted difference-in-differences estimator quantified a 12.3 percentage point increase (p {\textless} 0.0001) in full-year coverage post-{ACA} for {YAs} compared to older counterparts, driven by increases in employer-sponsored private insurance while younger and older youth saw larger gains in Medicaid coverage. Triple-difference estimators identified subgroups experiencing less beneficial dependent coverage expansion effects, including females, lower socioeconomic status, non-citizens, non-English speakers, and several racial/ethnic minority groups. Later {ACA} reforms (Marketplace/Medicaid expansions) mitigated many of these widening disparities.

Conclusion
While the {ACA} significantly impacted {YA} insurance coverage, these gains were not of equal magnitude for all {YAs} and disparities remain. As such, more work needs to be done to ensure optimal and equitable access to high-quality, affordable insurance for all {YAs}.},
